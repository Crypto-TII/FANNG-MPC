#   DEBUGMEM = Turns on some memory debugging (really only meant for Rust pipeline)

# Benchmark flags
#   BENCH_NETDATA = Enable benchmarking of network data

#   BENCH_OFFLINE = Estimate how much offline data is consumed

#   		      program and the daBit machine.
#   		    - The aBits/aANDs count counts all those used
#   		      by GC calls/sregint ops and GC. But not the
#   		      creation of the aANDs themselves
