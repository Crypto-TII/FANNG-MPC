""" This module is for classes of actual assembly instructions.
        Details:
        -Each Class name is the same as its opcode, except when indicated otherwise.
        -I/O Classes names differ in some cases from their opcode in order to facilitate readibility.
        -I/O SHARE instructions are used to implement Classes I/O SHARES, hence the variation on their class name,
    Remark: In comments C: stands for Class Name.

The memory based vector add/sub/mult instructions are not
accessable from Mamba. There syntax is
  INSTR i j k n
Where the size of the vector is in register rn
  ri, rj and rk point to the start of the vectors 
We then execute
    MEM[ri+t] = MEM[rj+t] op MEM[rk+t] t=0...rn-1

MINV* and MEVAL* are also not used in Mamba

   MREVC i j k
Takes memory pointed to by rj of length rk and puts it
in the reverse order in position ri

   MEVALSC i j k t
Takes S memory pointed to by rj of length rk and a
C variable ct and evaluates the poly in ct, returning
the result in register si

   MBITDECC i j k
Takes cint register cj and decomposes it into rk bits
and places them in C[ri+t] for t=0...rk-1

  MBITDECINT i j k
Takes register rj and decomposes it into rk bits
and places them in R[ri+t] for t=0...rk-1
 

Many instructions can be vectorized, this is done by taking the opcode
being a 32 bit value. The last nine bits being the base opcode and previous
23 bits being how many times the instruction should be executed in
parallel. If this first 23 bits are zero, then this is interpreted as
one. The arguments of a vectorized instruction given the first
of the consecutive registers which should be accessed in turn.

Arguments to instructions can have various types
    'c'   : Clear Modp Register a.k.a. cint (Read Only),
    'cw'  : Clear Modp Register (Write Only),
    's'   : Secret Modp Register a.k.a sint (Read Only),
    'sw'  : Secret Modp Register (Write Only),
    'r'   : Clear RegInt Register a.k.a. regint (64-bit value) (Read Only),
    'rw'  : Clear RegInt Register (64-bit value) (Write Only),
    'sb'  : A secret bit (Read Only)
    'sbw' : A secret bit (Write Only)
    'sr'  : A secret RegInt (64-bit value) (Read Only)
    'srw' : A secret RegInt (64-bit value) (Write Only)
    'i'  : Integer Value Possibly Signed
    'int': Integer Value Unsigned
    'p'  : A Player Number
    'str': String

Global memory comes in three variants, which is not thread locked
    S[i] : sint memory
    C[i] : cint memory
    R[i] : regint memory

Registers come in the same types, but are thread local

All base classes, utility functions etc. should go in instructions_base.py instead.

This is for two reasons:
1) Easier generation of documentation
2) Ensures that 'from instructions import *' will only import assembly instructions and nothing else.

Note: every instruction should have a suitable docstring for auto-generation of
documentation

The opcodes are copied here from instruction_base.py to here for ease of use in documentation)
