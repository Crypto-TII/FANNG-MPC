\mainsection{Basic Rust Types}
The main thing to keep in mind is that {\bf currently} the only
Rust type supported is the $\ints$ type.
However, if you {\bf use} another type it might cause neither an error nor a crash
of the compiler (at the moment, we want to fix this); so you
might get undefined behaviour.

While it works to just use integral constants almost everywhere,
it can be more efficient to use the \verb|ConstI32| and \verb|ConstU32| values
instead. This is because for example \verb|ClearModp::from(42)| will end
up creating two assembly instructions, one to load the $42$ into a
$\regint$ register, the second one for a conversion from $\regint$ to
$\cint$. If \verb|ClearModp::from(ConstI32::<42>)| is used instead, you
get just one assembly instruction to directly load a constant into a
$\cint$ register.

Similarly there are operations which are only supported on constants.
One example is dividing a \verb|SecretModp| by an integer, this only works
when using \verb|ConstI32|, as MPC has a special (and thus very efficient)
instruction for this kind of division.

All of the basic SCALE types in Rust support the \verb|Copy| and \verb|Clone| traits.
