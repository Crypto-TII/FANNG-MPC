/* This class manages the opening of shares
 * We have two types of opening.
 *    - OpenToAll
 *    - OpenToOne
 *
 * For SPDZ OpenToAll uses the MAC_Check to
 * ensure all is OK.
 *
 * For Q2 access structures OpenToAll uses
 * a restricted network and then reconstructs
 * and hashes the result (to be checked later).
 *
 * OpenToOne for SPDZ does just the naive sending
 * of shares. Only for use in the offline phase really
 *
 * OpenToOne for Q2 access structures sends all
 * the shares in, and then uses the parity check
 * matrix to ensure all is OK
