/* This implements the COT protocol in Figure 19 of ePrint 2015/901
 * The role of sender and receiver are reversed, so as to match
 * the sender and receiver of the initial seed ROT
 *
 * To get active security the outputs are then checked using the
 * protocol in Figure 7 of ePrint 2015/546.
 *
 * We do OT_comp_sec such OTs at once, so in terms of the above
 * paper kappa=OT_comp_sec, but as we use gf2n elements to store
 * the keys/mac/deltas and our gf2n class is fixed for GF(2^{128})
 * this means we are fixed (for now) to OT_comp_sec=128
