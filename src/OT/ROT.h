/* This defines a random OT protocol based on ECC Dual Mode
 * Encryption, from ePrint 2007/348.
 *
 * The issue with this is that a malicious sender can choose
 * the two messages to be identical. Thus this is not a good
 * OT for our application. It is therefore preferred to
 * use the one from ePrint 2015/267 defined in SimpleROT
 *
 * There are two classes a sender and a receiver.
 *
 * We assume here that the receiver always goes first
 * and the receiver always ends the protocol
 *   - We iterate calling sender/receiver as many times
 *     as it takes to complete the protocol
 * You can check if a protocol has completed by checking
 * the complete flag
