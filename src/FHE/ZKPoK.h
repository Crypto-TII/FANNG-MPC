#ifndef _ZKPOK
#define _ZKPOK

/* This class gives the method to perform the ZKPoK of
 * correctness of plaintexts
 *
 * Each player runs an instance of ZKPoK
 *   When single=true this runs as the prover or verifier
 *   otherwise it runs as the prover being all (as in 
 *   HighGear/TopGear), with a sum as the final statement.
 *   The former case is needed for FHE_IO creation. When
 *   single=true we need to know if we are the prover
 *   or the verifier
 *
 * Step 1:
 *
 * It generates the plaintext/ciphertexts according to
 * the flag of type condition (from Plaintext.h) which
 * is either General or Diagonal
 *
 * For HighGear U = ZK_sound_sec and V= 2*U-1
 * For TopGear  V = ZK_sound_sec/log_2(2*N+1) and U = 2*V
 *
 * It then generates U plaintexts and randomness' for this 
 * player, as well as V test "fake" ciphertexts
 *    - Fake as the distributions are all screwy from
 *      a valid ciphertext. This is to get the proof to
 *      work
 *    - If Diagonal then the U ciphertexts are all identical, 
 *      and we set the Diagonal element to be "alpha" (which 
 *      in the end will be the MAC key)
 *
 * The encryptions of the V fake ciphertexts (A) are then
 * returned, along with the U ones (E) we are going to be 
 * using later on.
 *
 *
 * Step 2:
 *
 * The players then agree on a random vector e of size
 * V consisting of 
 *   - HighGear zeros and ones.
 *   - TopGear elements from {X^i}_{i=0}^{2N-1} \cup {0}
 *
 * This stage then computes the z^{(i)},^{(i)}T pairs for
 * each player to compute (see the documentation Line 6 of
 * the protocol spec for what these are)
 *
 *
 * Step 3:
 *
 * This is the stage which performs the final check.
 *
 * Step 4:
 *
 * This allows one (up to U) times to recover both the ciphertext 
 * sum, and the plaintext for this player for the valid ciphertexts 
 * selected at the beginiing.
